## Overview
This project was started because while there are log monitoring solutions and even
a few realtime website analytics products out there I have not found that right
mix of features in an opensource project that scratched all the right places.

There are a few primary use cases for this software, namely:

*  High performance log aggregation from servers, applications and security appliances.
*  Security Event Monitoring and Evaluation
*  Simple website analytics

## System Components
There are three major components of the system.  The collectors which capture and
forward log events, the event sink which processes the data and stores information
in the database and the viewers which display the information.

### Collectors

*  [IIS7 Native Syslog Module](/collectors/nativeiis7.html) -- This component
   relays data from IIS Servers to the Event Sinks
*  [Apache Piped Log Data](/collectors/apache-win.html) -- Specifications for
   configuring Apache to send data to the event sink.  A reference application
   is included for windows.
*  [Log4Net UDP Appender Configuration](/collectors/log4net.html) -- A
   configuration for Log4Net so that application error data is sent to the Event
   Sink.

### Sinks

*  [Console Testing Sink](/sinks/console.html) -- A very simple Event Sink that
   writes out event data to the console window.  This is useful for testing.
*  [Event Processing Windows Service](/sinks/windowsservice.html) -- The primary
   Event Sink program.  This tool logs event data into a MongoDB and provides
   processing options using NEsper for event correlation and analysis.

### Viewers

*  Web Dashboard -- A MVC3 .NET website for viewing event data using tables and
   graphs generated from data stored in the Mongo database populated by the 
   [Event Processing Windows Service](/sinks/windowsservice.html).
