## Native IIS7 Collector

### Overview

The IIS7 Event collector is a C++ HTTPModule which will run in 32 and 64 bit
application pools.  The module is implemented in C++ as a native module instead
of as a managed module (which would have been easier to code) because the flexibility
is needed for the module to run in any application pool on the server.  A managed
httpmodule would only function in integrated mode.

### Installation
The IIS7 Event Collector module is designed to be installed as a global module
in the root configuration of IIS.  By installing this way all websites configured
on the IIS server will have the module included in their processing pipelines.

In order to install the module this way the root configurations of IIS must be
modified.  This is a straight forward process but it goes without saying that you
should probably make backup copies of all of these files before making changes -- 
even if you know what you are doing.

The first step is to build the NativeSyslogModule project in both 32bit and 64bit
formats.  The easiest way to do this is to open the 
`/source/Collectors/IIS7/NativeSyslogPublisher.vcxproj` in Visual Studio and build
both 32 and 64bit release targets.  There are two DLL files which must be copied on
to the servers (along with the MSVCRT100.dll files if not present).  Keep track of
the paths to the files because they are used below.

#### applicationHost.config
There are several pieces to edit in this file.  The first step is to register
the configuration section near the top of the file.
<% code 'xml' do %>
 <configSections>
    ...
    <sectionGroup name="system.webServer">
        <section name="nativeSyslogPublisher" overrideModeDefault="Deny" />
        ...
    </sectionGroup>
 </configSections>
<% end %>

Next up are the references to the assemblies themselves.  Make sure the bitness flags match the
assembly formats or IIS will not function.
<% code 'xml' do %>
 <globalModules>
    ...
    <add name="NativeSyslogPublisher" 
    image="PATH-TO-FILE\NativeSyslogPublisher.dll" preCondition="bitness32" />
    <add name="NativeSyslogPublisher-x64" 
    image="PATH-TO-FILE\NativeSyslogPublisher-64.dll" preCondition="bitness64" />	
 </globalModules>
<% end %>

The nativeSyslogPublisher directive is the piece we registered at the top of the file.
There are several different properties which can be set in this section.  The defaults
are generally fine except for the logServer property which should be set to the IP address
of your server that is running the Event Sink.  The rest of the properties can be found
in the NativeSyslogPublisher_schema.xml file.
<% code 'xml' do %>
   <nativeSyslogPublisher logServer="127.0.0.1" />
<% end %>
 
While the DLL files were registered above and will be loaded by IIS on startup, this
section actually associates the modules with every application pool.  The lockItem
directive will prevent the modules from being removed from the app pool if set.
<% code 'xml' do %>
 <location path="" overrideMode="Allow">
     <system.webServer>
         <modules>
             ...
             <add name="NativeSyslogPublisher" lockItem="false" 
             preCondition="bitness32" />
             <add name="NativeSyslogPublisher-x64" lockItem="false"
             preCondition="bitness64" />
         </modules>
     </system.webServer>
 </location>
<% end %>

### Development
The IIS7 Module is feature complete at this point.  There may be some bug fixing
required but at this time there are no outstanding issues.  It would be possible
to port this code so that it would run on IIS6 by binding to slightly different
notifications since these changed between IIS6 and IIS7.  That said there is no
effort being applied to build an IIS6 version because it is old and very inferior
to IIS7.

#### Bindings
The HTTP Module hooks the start request and send response events.  It is important
for computing the correct timing that we are near the first of the modules to be 
called at the start of the request and for when the request is sent.  Paradoxically
we must be the lowest priority for the send response registration.  This is explained
by the need for most important filters to have the final say in changing a response
on send.

<% code 'c++' do %>
    // to properly capture time we need to capture the starting ticks before
    // any others.
    hr = pModuleInfo->SetPriorityForRequestNotification(RQ_BEGIN_REQUEST,
                                                        PRIORITY_ALIAS_FIRST);
    // For send response priority is inverted.  Because we are capturing
    // timing for TTFB we come first (lowest priority) here.
    hr = pModuleInfo->SetPriorityForRequestNotification(RQ_SEND_RESPONSE,
                                                        PRIORITY_ALIAS_LAST);
<% end %>

#### Starting the Capture
grab the current time, setup some variables (these are all local as a new instance
is created for each and every request.  that sounds expensive)
