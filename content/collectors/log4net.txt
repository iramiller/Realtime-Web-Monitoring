## log4net Configuration

The log4net library comes with the ability to relay event data for the monitoring
system out of the box using the UdpAppender and a specific configuration.  Since
we are using a standard appender all of the basic log4net features such as filtering
by priority and source are available.

#### log4net Config

In order to use the configuration sample the `RemoteAddress` of the log server must
be set along with the `APP-NAME` in the configuration fragment below.

<% code 'xml' do %>
<log4net>
	<appender name="RealtimeMonitoringAppender" type="log4net.Appender.UdpAppender">
		<param name="RemoteAddress" value="127.0.0.1" />
		<param name="RemotePort" value="514" />
		<layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout, log4net">
			<param name="ConversionPattern" value="&lt;110&gt;
%date{MMM dd HH:mm:ss} %property{log4net:HostName} L4N: %p APP-NAME %c - %m" />
		</layout>
	</appender>
	<root>
		<level value="INFO" />
		<appender-ref ref="RealtimeMonitoringAppender" />
	</root>
</log4net>
<% end %>
__NOTE:__ The forced line break in the `ConversionPattern` is for display formatting only
and must be removed for this fragment to work properly.

This log4net configuration is the proper format for a SYSLOG RFC3164 message and
can be used for any application that would like to send log4net data to a syslog
server.
